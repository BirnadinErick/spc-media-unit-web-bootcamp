Welcome! This bootcamp written form will serve as a temperary guide to learn bare-basics of web development
where I will teach you the mechanics involved when a frontend-heavy content-based web application development.
I want each of you to go through on your own pace and attend the in-person gathering at the School every
Wednesday!

First things, prerequisites. This bootcamp assumes you are already familiar with basic programming in general
through experiences assimilated via Scratch. Though deep understanding of Datastructures and algorithms are not
required, I strongly advice you to go for it.

The bootcamp will be laid-out like this:

1. Javascript vs Scratch
2. Building a house called JS
3. A CLI Scientific Calculator
4. HTML & CSS
5. DOM
6. Manipulate DOM with JS
7. Events & JS
8. Astro: a JS framework
9. HTMX
10. PHP: a spark
11. SQL intro
12. HTMX and PHP: Comments Section
13. How SPC-175 works
14. How to maintain and enhance SPC-175
15. Mathew: a custom butler for SPC-175

> Above list is non-exhaustive at the moment!
